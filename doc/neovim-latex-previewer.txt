*neovim-latex-previewer.txt*      Live previewing of latex projects.

This plugin is designed to do live pdf updates of latex projects for preview.

                                        *nvim-latex-previewer-dependencies*
Dependencies~
nvim-latex-previewer uses latexmk to typeset documents and does a unionmount
with fuse to superimpose the edited versions of files over the current saved
versions. It therefore depends on: >
    mupdf (currently the only fully supported previewer)
    unionmount-fuse
    latexmk (currently the only supported compiler)
    xdotool (for sync)

                                            *nvim-latex-previewer-features*
Features~
The main idea of this plugin was to help me typeset my thesis. Several latex
previewers for vim exist, but this one has two different diff modes, which work
on projects with multiple files.

By setting the mode to diff, you see the differences between the version of the
file that you are currently typing and the version which is saved to disk.

By setting the mode to git, you see the differences between the version of the
file that you are currently typing and the latest commit.


                                             *nvim-latex-previewer-cleanup*
Cleanup~
From time to time, if nvim-latex-previewer fails to compile correctly it may
leave a unionmount in place. The mountpoint should have the form: >

    /tmp/nvim*/#/#/mount
<
(where * is a sequence of letters and each # is a number).

These mounts can be cleaned manually if necessary by executing: >
    fusermount -u /path/to/mount
<

                                      *nvim-latex-previewer-magic-comments*
TeX Magic Comments~
The previewer behavior can be modified by beginning your document with a "magic
comment".
                                                *nvim-latex-previewer-root*
The most important is the TeX root directive: >

    % !TeX root = main.tex

<
Which tells the previewer which file to feed to tex. The previewer expects all
files referenced by the root directory to be in some subdirectory of the
directory that contains it.

                                             *nvim-latex-previewer-program*
The next directive is the TeX program directive: >

    % !TeX program = latex

<
you can use this to set the program to tex (plain tex), latex, xetex, or luatex.
If you set it to anything else, it will run latex, but change the -progname.
This may change the format files that are used.

                                             *nvim-latex-previewer-options*
Finally, we have the TeX options directive: >

    % !TeX options = nonstop, synctex

<
You can use this to set a list of command-line options for latex:

Setting         command-line options~
enc             -enc -ini                 
flerror         -file-line-error          
!flerror        -no-file-line-error       
ini             -ini                      
batch           -interaction=batchmode    
nonstop         -interaction=nonstopemode 
scroll          -interaction=scrollmode   
errorstop       -interaction=errorstopmode
shellescape     -shell-escape             
!shellescape    -no-shell-escape          
srcspecials     -src-specials             
!srcspecials    -no-src-specials          
synctex         -synctex=1                
!synctex        -synctex=0                

                                            *nvim-latex-previewer-commands*
nvim-latex-previewer commands~
nvim-latex-previewer defines the following commands: 
>
    :LatexPreview
<
Immediately compiles the document and opens the preview.
>
    :LatexPreviewOn
    :LatexPreviewOff
    :LatexPreviewToggle
<
Enable or disable live preview. When previewing is first enabled, the document
will be typeset and (if successful) will open in the selected viewer (for now,
that means MuPDF).
>
    :LatexPreviewMode <mode>
    :NextLatexPreviewMode
    :PrevLatexPreviewMode
<
This sets the preview mode. Choices are:
Setting Behavior~
plain   Typeset the current version of the document in the buffer. (default)
diff    Typeset the diff of the current version against the saved version.
git     Typeset the current version of the document against the git master.

>
    :LatexPreviewTimer <n>
<
Set a timer for compilation. When enabled, the document will update every <n>
seconds. To disable this feature, set the timer interval to -1.
>
    :LatexPreviewSyncOn
    :LatexPreviewSyncOff
    :LatexPreviewSyncToggle
<
Enable or disable sync mode (enabled by default). When sync mode is enabled,
the preview will fast-forward to the page containing the text being edited
each time it updates.
>
    :LatexPreviewCacheOn
    :LatexPreviewCacheOff
    :LatexPreviewCacheToggle
>
Enable or disable the preview cache. When this is enabled, a folder named .nlp
will be created in the directory containing the project root, in which all
files created during compilation will be stored. This can help improve
initial compile speed when reopening the document but has no other benefits.
>
    :LatexPreviewWriteMode <mode>
<
This setting determines which files are saved to the project's root directory. 
It can be any of the following:

Setting                 Behavior ~
0                       No files are saved.
!tex                    Saves all files with extensions other than tex.
<ext1>|<ext2>           Saves all files with extension ext1 or ext2. This list
                        can contain any number of extensions separated by |

The default setting is 'pdf'.
>
    :LatexViewer <viewer>
<
The executable used for viewing the document. Only mupdf will sync, but other
viewers will likely open correctly at least.

>
    :LatexPreviewLog
<
Shows a log of the last compile. This will generate errors if the document has
not been compiled yet, and will update when the document is recompiled
(specifically to avoid problems with timed compilation).
